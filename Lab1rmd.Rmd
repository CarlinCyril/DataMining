## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


**2**)



**b**)
if we take the formula of both predictors in replacing, we have :
$$\begin{aligned}
Y_{i} = 2 + 4X_{1,i} + \epsilon_{2,i} + \epsilon_{3,i} \\
      =  2 + X_{2,i} + \epsilon_{1,i} + \epsilon_{3,i}
\end{aligned}$$


In theory, we should have for the first predictor $\beta_{0} = 2$ and $\beta_{1} = 4$ then for the second predictor $\beta_{0} = 2$ and $\beta_{2} = 1$. We realize the linear regression in R. 
```{r}
set.seed(3)
n=10
X1=rnorm(n)
X2=3*X1+rnorm(n)
Y=2+X1+X2+rnorm(n)
predictor1 <- lm(Y~X1)
predictor2 <- lm(Y~X2)
b01=predictor1$coefficients[1]
b1=predictor1$coefficients[2]
b02=predictor2$coefficients[1]
b2=predictor2$coefficients[2]
summary(predictor1)
summary(predictor2)
list(beta0=b01,beta1=b1,beta0=b02,beta1=b2)


```


First of all, the two models have a good R-square so that seems to be good models.
But, in the first model, the $\beta_{0}$ is enough far of the theory value and in the second model, it's the $\beta_{2}$.
So, the predictors are not really good that's perhaps due to the sum of the different residuals terms.
